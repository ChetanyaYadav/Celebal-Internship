# Celebal-Internship
Welcome to my SQL portfolio, built during my internship at Celebal Technologies. This repository showcases a range of SQL queries, scripts, and mini-projects that reflect my hands-on experience, logical thinking, and continuous learning in database management and data analysis using SQL.

üìò Full Installation Guide: AdventureWorks 2019 OLTP Database on SQL Server
AdventureWorks is a sample database provided by Microsoft, designed to demonstrate features of SQL Server through a fictional bicycle manufacturing company. It is widely used in learning environments, certifications, and SQL tutorials.

This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up the AdventureWorks 2019 OLTP database on your local SQL Server instance. Whether you're a student, beginner, or data enthusiast, follow this step-by-step guide to get started with your SQL practice.

üß± Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure the following:

You have SQL Server installed on your system (2016 or later is recommended; SQL Server 2019 or newer is ideal).

You have SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed. SSMS is a free tool by Microsoft used for managing SQL Server.

Administrative access to SQL Server to restore databases.

An internet connection to download the database backup file.

üì• Step 1: Download the AdventureWorks 2019 OLTP Database Backup File
The AdventureWorks database is available on Microsoft‚Äôs official GitHub repository for SQL Server samples.

Open your browser and go to:
üëâ https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples

Navigate to:
samples/databases/adventure-works

Find the AdventureWorks2019.bak file or directly visit this link to download it:
üîó AdventureWorks2019.bak - Direct Download

Save the .bak file to a convenient location on your computer, such as C:\Backups\.

üîÑ Step 2: Restore the AdventureWorks Database Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Follow these steps to restore the database using SSMS:

Launch SSMS:

Open SQL Server Management Studio.

Connect to your SQL Server instance using your credentials.

Open the Restore Database Window:

Right-click on the Databases folder in the Object Explorer pane.

Select Restore Database....

Select Source Device:

In the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù section, choose Device.

Click the ... (browse) button.

In the ‚ÄúSelect backup devices‚Äù dialog box, click Add.

Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .bak file (e.g., C:\Backups\AdventureWorks2019.bak) and select it.

Click OK to return to the Restore Database window.

Choose the Restore Point:

In the "Restore Database" window, you‚Äôll see a checkbox under "Restore" in the lower pane.

Check the box to select the backup set to restore.

Adjust the Restore Settings (Optional but Recommended):

Switch to the Files page from the left panel to change the location of database files if needed.

Ensure the database name is set to AdventureWorks2019 or another name of your choice.

Start Restore Process:

Click OK to begin restoring.

You‚Äôll receive a confirmation message when the restore is successful.

‚úÖ Step 3: Verify the AdventureWorks Database
Once restored:

Refresh the Databases folder in Object Explorer.

You should now see AdventureWorks2019 listed.

Expand the database to browse tables, views, and stored procedures.

To test that everything is working correctly, run a simple query:

sql
Copy
Edit
USE AdventureWorks2019;
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Person.Person;
If the query runs and displays data, your installation is successful!

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips
Permission Errors: Run SSMS as an Administrator if you face permission issues during restoration.

File Path Errors: If SQL Server cannot access the .bak file path, copy the backup file to a folder like C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\ and try again.

Database Already Exists: If you receive an error stating the database already exists, either delete the existing one or restore under a different name.

üß† Additional Notes
The AdventureWorks2019 OLTP version is optimized for transactional operations and is the most commonly used edition for learning.

You can explore other editions as well such as AdventureWorksDW2019 (Data Warehouse) for analytical tasks.

Always make sure your SQL Server version is compatible with the database file you're restoring.

üéì You're All Set!
You‚Äôve successfully set up the AdventureWorks2019 database on your SQL Server. You're now ready to write queries, practice joins, work with stored procedures, and solve real-world business problems using this sample data.
üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
This repository contains a curated set of beginner-to-intermediate level SQL query tasks using the AdventureWorks2019 database‚Äîa sample OLTP database provided by Microsoft for learning and testing SQL Server features.

üìò Installation Guide: AdventureWorks2019 OLTP on SQL Server
To follow along with the queries in this repository, you must first install and restore the AdventureWorks2019 OLTP database on your local SQL Server instance. Here‚Äôs a quick setup guide.

üß± Prerequisites
SQL Server 2016 or newer (SQL Server 2019+ recommended)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Admin access to your SQL Server instance

Internet connection (to download the .bak file)

üì• Step 1: Download Backup File
Download the official backup file (AdventureWorks2019.bak) from Microsoft‚Äôs GitHub:

üîó AdventureWorks2019.bak - GitHub Link

Save it to a path like: C:\Backups\AdventureWorks2019.bak

üîÑ Step 2: Restore Database in SSMS
Launch SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Connect to your local server.

In Object Explorer:

Right-click Databases ‚Üí Restore Database...

Select Device, then add the .bak file.

Check the restore box and adjust file locations if needed.

Click OK to restore.

‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Installation
Once restored:

sql
Copy
Edit
USE AdventureWorks2019;
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Person.Person;
If the query returns rows, your setup is complete.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips
Permission Issues: Run SSMS as Administrator.

File Path Errors: Copy the .bak file to a trusted SQL path like C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL...\Backup\.

Database Already Exists: Use a different name or delete the existing one before restoring.

üß† Additional Notes
The AdventureWorks2019 OLTP version is best for practicing transactional operations.

For analytical tasks, explore AdventureWorksDW2019 (data warehouse variant).

Always confirm SQL Server compatibility with the .bak file version.
